<br/>
For this workshop, we invite participants to send us one or  multiples anecdote(s) relating to design and humanities.  

         <b>Getting humanities and design together?</b>
        <p>
        For example, designers use the method of “scenario” that is also a concept in the humanities to qualify a certain format of narration. “Scenarios” therefore are both useful to the practitioner to invent and communicate a new interaction with a product or a service. “Scenarios” are also used by critic to analyze styles, genders, original contribution, impact on  the public. Another example is the word “metaphor”, used by designers to organize a translation between two fields of reference and analyzed by humanities scholars to address the originality of the poetic work. 
        </p>

        <b>Goal: increasing our understanding of design practices</b>
        <p>
        Like “scenarios” and “metaphors”, multiples concepts are shared across these two domains. First, we want to understand more clearly what are these concepts and what they mean and borrow from each domains. Second, we want to explore other humanities related practices and concepts to see if they shed some light on the design process. 
        </p>

        <b>Humanities in action</b>
        <p>
        Humanities are known for their capacity to analyze results of a creative process. Here we want to explore how designers use humanities ideas or concepts in their work, to structure their design activities and outcomes.  “Humanities in action” can help the designer by making explicit what happens in  the work itself. By humanities we mean the whole field of creative expression and analysis of arts and literature, including techniques from painting, photography, cinema, performing arts,… What about looking at oxymorons as the basis of creative practices (Gentes, 2017)? What about the concept of “spatial montage” (Manovitch, 2001)? What does zooming-in and zooming-could tell us about design?
        </p>

        <b>Why Anecdotes?</b>
        <p>
        By “design anecdote(s)” we mean different amusing or interesting stories that happened to you or your peers, during the design process of an artefact, service, system or media. We are also interested in reported historical anecdotes that also sustain our enquiry. These anecdotes will be used during the activity as a resource or a tool for discussing interesting social phenomena, concepts, process  important to both design and humanities.
        </p>

        When we tell anecdotes, we let our experience surprise us. Past and present merge, and we can get insights into what happened and what it means.
        These anecdotes could cover : 
        humanities method used during design process 
        humanities concepts influencing design 
        challenges meet during a design process
        word influence during generation of designs
        semiotics practices of design…
